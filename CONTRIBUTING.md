# Contributing to awesome-marp

Thank you for taking the time to read how to contribute to awesome-marp! This is the guideline for contributing to awesome-marp.

awesome-marp is hosted by Marp team, and also following [**the contributing guideline of Marp team projects**](https://github.com/marp-team/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). _You have to read this before starting work._

## Guidelines

### Follow [the awesome manifesto](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/main/awesome.md)

ðŸ‘‰ https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/main/awesome.md

The awesome list is only including actual awesome stuff. So contributors should put stuff on the list that Marp team or Marp community can actually recommend. This list is not a place for personal promotion of presentations or slides made with Marp.

> [!TIP]
> If you have created something new about Marp, you can use [the "Show and tell" category of the GitHub Discussion forum](https://github.com/orgs/marp-team/discussions/categories/show-and-tell) to get attention from Marp community.

### Keep formatting

- When adding a new item to the curated list, recommend to follow the alphabetical ordering per groups.
- To each pushed commits and pull requests, awesome-marp checks Markdown formatting with Prettier and runs awesome-lint linter.

#### Fix Prettier formatting

```
npm run format:write
```

#### Run awesome-lint linter

```
npm run lint
```

### Pull requests

- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- The pull request should have a meaningful title, include a link to the new stuff, and why it's awesome.
- In the list, keep descriptions short and simple, but descriptive.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Before requesting a review, please ensure that the CI passes.
